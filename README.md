# TensorFX samples

This repository contains the latest set of samples demonstrating using TensorFX
to train and predict with TensorFlow models.

In order to run the samples, you'll need to install a few python libraries. The
recommendation is to use [Miniconda](https://conda.io/miniconda.html) for your
Python environment, and optionally use a conda virtual environment to isolate
installations. In your environment, run the following commands:

    pip install tensorflow
    pip install tensorfx
